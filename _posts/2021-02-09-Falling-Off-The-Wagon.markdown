## Well that was quick...

So after starting the blog in high spirits it quite quickly all went a bit sideways... I started so enthusiastically but hit a wall pretty much straight away. The issue wasn't that I didn't want to stick to the plan, but that I struggled to feel like the small amount of coding I was doing here and there was anything worth blogging about or worth noting in my `#100DaysOfCode` diary. I've realised this is a recurring theme for me.

### Not valuing the small recurring efforts enough

I think I find it all too easy to disparage the effort I've put into learning something if the results seem mediocre for the amount of time and effort spent. This is probably a direct result of my ADHD making me feel like my focus and attention are fragmented at the best of times, so everything I work on ends up feeling 'bitty' and like it takes a lot longer than it should.

A lifetime of this has left me doubting myself, as there is truth in it, but I also know that I approach learning differently from most people, how that is different is part of what I'm trying to figure out through this process of blogging and coding. 

### Playing to my strengths (...by also knowing my weaknesses)

If I'm going to overcome these obstacles I'm going to need to figure out what works for ME and maybe more importantly knowing what DOESN'T work. I'm starting from a mostly blank page, although there is extensive resources out there around learning with ADHD it is mostly focussed on Children, the effects of ADHD on adults is still a relatively new area of medical study and exploration.

### My Strengths (As I see them...)

- A myriad of interests.

   > I can't seem to limit my interests to a single path, I ENJOY going down rabbit holes of brand new knowledge and ideas I've never encountered before, the trick is remembering to come back up for air and check in with myself on what I was originally trying to do.

- A deep thinker.

    > A lifetime of self doubt from before the diagnosis has left me with a somewhat intense and defensive analytical approach to thinking. It's not paranoia, but a self taught coping mechanism to prevent myself being caught off guard by thinking about and exploring all the options available in a given scenario, and then placing each of those into the context of the larger picture. It's not in my nature to do things frivolously, I want to create things that work well, don't break anything else and are flexible to future change. I know my attention span and excitement can cause me to go down rabbit holes, so I need to be able to pick up anything I was working on beforehand quickly and get right back into it. I think this is why I am drawn to TDD/BDD as a core software development practice.

- Determined.

    > This is a funny one... I hesitated when writing this, I think up until recently I always thought I was a bit ambivalent or lackluster in my approach to life, but actually in the context of ADHD, to be constantly distracted with the impulsive need for stimulation yet keep coming back to tasks which may not provide that but are necessary, that takes A LOT of energy, commitment and resolve. I can push myself incredibly hard to persist with something I want to or need to understand, I've had to learn to do so, I had no choice! To achieve anything in my life without it turning into a purely hedonistic joy ride required me to persist at things my ADHD brain may not find stimulating. Many people with ADHD (especially men) often end up with unhealthy dependencies or destructive behaviors trying to seek out things that can scratch that ADHD need for stimulation. In my past I got caught up in computer games to an unhealthy degree, but it could have easily been worse. Despite that I have pushed through and managed to achieve things in my life so far, that while small to most people, are incredible achievements in the context of ADHD.

### End of part 1...

I've chosen to stop here as there's a lot to digest. This is going to be an ongoing journey, so I have chosen to label this 'Part 1' which I can expand on later as I continue improving my understanding.

Thankyou for reading if you've got this far.
