## Well that was quick...

So after starting the blog in high spirits it quite quickly all went a bit sideways... I started so enthusiastically but hit a wall pretty much straight away. The issue wasn't that I didn't want to stick to the plan, but that I struggled to feel like the small amount of coding I was doing here and there was anything worth blogging about or worth noting in my `#100DaysOfCode` diary. I've realised this is a recurring theme for me.

### Not valuing the small recurring efforts enough

I think I find it all too easy to disparage the effort I've put into learning something if the results seem mediocre for the amount of time and effort spent. This is probably a direct result of my ADHD making me feel like my focus and attention are fragmented at the best of times, so everything I work on ends up feeling 'bitty' and like it takes a lot longer than it should.

A lifetime of this has left me doubting myself, as there is truth in it, but I also know that I approach learning differently from most people, how that is different is part of what I'm trying to figure out through this process of blogging and coding. 

### Playing to my strengths (...by also knowing my weaknesses)

If I'm going to overcome these obstacles thrown at me by the neurotypical 'norm'. I'm going to need to figure out what works for ME and maybe more importantly knowing what DOESN'T work. I'm starting from a mostly blank page, although there is extensive resources out there around learning with ADHD it is mostly focussed on Children, the effects of ADHD on adults is still a relatively new area of exploration.
