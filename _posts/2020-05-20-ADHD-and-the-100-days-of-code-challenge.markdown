## 100 Days of code - The challenges ahead

This isn't going to be easy, I've been putting this off for a while for multiple reasons...

### Some background...

It's very easy as a developer to look around and see so many other people picking up programming skills and running with them in a way that looks so effortless and easy that you start to wonder why 'you' can't do that too.

The impostor syndrome creeps in, made all the worse if you are neurodivergent like I am.

I have ADHD which means staying on track and focused is challenging at the best of times, it's not that I don't have the energy or enthusiasm or want to learn, it's almost the opposite, my need is almost too great, and it overwhelms my brain in to scattering it's effort across dozens of areas. It's a bit like shooting a shotgun at a barn door from 100m away, sure your going to 'hit' the door but the energy is so spread out it's probably not going to leave much of a mark.

Then you see everyone else using a handgun and hitting their target effectively every time, and wondering if they are looking at you as if your daft. Anyone can pick up a handgun, and with minimal safety training and instruction probably go right ahead and hit that barn door first try right? so why can't I?

That's working on the assumption that everyone is given the right tool for the job.

### My brain is different...

I'm not trying to typecast myself, or claim I have some kind of superpower. The notion of ADHD and the ability for the ADHD brain to hyperfocus is often portrayed as a unique skill and a kind of superpower, it is a unique trait, but it's an inconsistent and temperamental one, not something that can be relied on. What is required is a plan, a framework for focus and directing the flow of my effort and energy.

This challenge, for me, will be taking on the added dimension of trying to discover and create a workflow that allows my brain to be consistent in this endeavour. This problem isn't just unique to ADHD, it happens to everyone to an extent, which makes it hard to have a conversation with others about why it is a struggle without coming across as making excuses for poor time management. But it's much more than that, at it's core ADHD is an Executive Functioning disorder where the brain is constantly searching for stimulus which gives it that endorphin hit of achievement. Obstacles in the way of reaching that endorphin hit are extra frustrating, the ADHD brain is prone to switching very quickly to the next source of stimulus if something is not meeting its expectations. That's not to say I am a slave to my brain, I can push it in a direction I want to go, but it takes more energy than it would for a neurotypical person as I constantly fight my brain to stay on track.

### So whats the point of all this?

Honestly, it's accountability, I'm putting this out there as a way to hold myself to account for the duration of this challenge. I'm also hoping that it doubles up as a log of what works or doesn't work and what I've learned from the experience. At the least it will also help me to keep track of where I am in the challenge too, because I'm almost certain to fall off the wagon at some point but will need to get back on it when I remember.

### What do I hope to achieve?

- I want to improve my programming skills by doing real projects instead of endless tutorials that have no real basis in the real world.
- The physical repetition of a task seems to help me much more than just reading/watching and following a tutorials steps.
- I'm very interested in 'workflows' for obvious reasons, nothing I've seen out there tutorial wise takes you from the very beginning of setting up a code repository and pipeline, adding automated unit and build tests, using TDD/BDD practices in the developing process and then deploying in a CI/CD way, it's all an incredibly fragmented and uncoordinated mess out there right now, with too many options and not enough consistency, this 'bothers' me as it is a blocker to my work flow, I hope to discover a process that works for me.
- I'll hopefully have a nice portfolio of work from it that I can be proud of.
